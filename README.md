<h1>Data roles and skill set</h1>

<p>
This repository is about my experience with data and how I see the work of some of the most famous functions in the data area.
It is open for discussion, I'll try to keep it updated as I change my opinions (which I certainly will).
</p>

<h2>
About the ""method"" I chose.
</h2>
<p>
I listed the most used abilities in the data area and compressed them until they were in common use between at least 2 positions. 
It is important to point out that I did not focus only on hard skills and that soft skills are just as important.
I gave grades from 1 to 10 (based on my experience) according to the use and the necessary level of knowledge for that skill.

<h2 align='center'>Skill explanations</h2>


> <strong>Applied math.</strong>

<p>
Applied mathematics is the area of mathematics that looks for ways to solve problems in companies especially in areas of finance, expansion, logistics and marketing, it is widely used (mandatory skill for people who deal with data) in data-oriented companies.
The grades increase as the position needs to be closer to business-related indicators such as revenue, operating costs, CHURN, retention, etc.
</p>


> <strong>Advanced math.</strong>
<p>
Firstly, with advanced mathematics focused on data I mean the use of some areas such as calculus, probability, advanced statistics, linear regression among many other areas, it is distinguished from applied mathematics because, unlike it, advanced mathematics does not pass by """lots of changes""" in functions due to business rules, as opposed to applied math which is basically modeled by business rules.
</p>

> <strong>SQL</strong>
<p>
Although it is quite obvious that functions around data must have knowledge in SQL, this knowledge does not have the same levels in different positions. SQL subsets are responsible for this great differentiation of levels since many of the positions do not necessarily need to know DCL, DDL, DML commands.
The levels serve precisely to separate the subsets, following this line of reasoning I created a "straight line of wisdom".
</p>
<b>DQL > DTL > DQL ADVANCED > DML > DDL > DCL</b>

> <strong>Programming</strong>
<p>
Programming is very present in data areas, whether in languages such as python, scala, pl/sql for creating routines and pipelines or M, DAX for manipulating data in specific software.
Leveling up for the different areas is about how much the job requires you to write thoughtfully (imaginary) along with the languages you will use in your day-to-day life.
